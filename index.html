                    Current Portfolio website you are viewing! I created this site to showcase my skills and notable
                    projects, but also to
                    practice and refine my skills in web development. It's not perfect, but it's far better than my earlier works and for that I'm proud.
                    I look forward to continue practicing and learning more about web development and design.

                    For the Web Design,
                    I used the BULMA framework because their no Javascript components proved to be very fast and
                    lightweight.
                    I added a few custom CSS classes, namely for the project's grid to complete my minimalist
                    aesthetic.
                    I used javascript to add extra functionality to the site.
                    I added an animation to the explore button which would smoothly scroll and link to a page anchor.
                    And then I added email functionality which both hid my email(from spammers) but allowed real users
                    to click the icon and have my email copied to their clipboard.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The site is still a huge work in progress but I am proud of what I have made so far, and I am

                <h1 class="title has-text-centered">UCI Hackathon Investment Prediction App</h1>
                <p>For UCI Hackathon 2017, I, along with some of my friends, created an investment app that utilized
                    machine learning and natural language sentiment to determine the
                    viability of investing in a certain stock.
                    <br>
                    <br> 
                    This app was created in Ruby, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                    The app first utilized the Nokogiri Ruby gem to web scrape
                    Seeking Alpha(A stock information website). It would search for recent articles on an inputted
                    stock, for example, AAPL(Apple). We would then use Google's
                    Natural Language API to perform sentiment analysis on the various articles. Sentiment analysis
                    would determine if the outlook of the stocks were good or bad
                    which allowed us to determine investment viability. Finally, the front end and extra functionality
                    of the web app utilized HTML, CSS, and Javascript and was router with Python through flask. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While our algorithm isn't perfect and we didn't have much time to test our app, we, especially me,
                    am very proud that we were able to create this app in 2 days.
                    I learned a lot about Machine Learning, Sentiment Analysis, and Web Scraping. Overall, the time
                    spent on this project was very valuable and I would love to
                    continue working on projects like this.

                    My first Machine Learning Model. This linear regression is able to take a dataset consisting of multiple inputs and one output; And using that
                    data, create a hypothesis or model to predict new outcomes with new inputs not found in the original training set.

                    <p> Over the summer, I self-studied and took various courses on Machine Learning. My first and most refined
                            model is a Multifeautre Linear Regression Model.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This model was written in Python from scratch. I did not use machine learning libraries such as
                            TensorFlow or SciKitLearn because I wanted to be sure
                            I understood the theoretical and mathematical implications of what I learned to see if I really knew
                            what I was doing. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            What this model does is take
                            multiple inputs(features) and predicts outputs based on the initial training data. For example, if I
                            gave the model training data with inputs such as
                            house size, house height, and house year, along with an output of those inputs such as final house
                            price; The model will analyze the data and create a
                            hypothesis or prediction model that will be able to estimate an output(such as house price) from new
                            inputs not found in original training set. I also
                            implemented feature scaling to speed up the runtime of the model.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Creating this model was extremely fun and it let me apply my theoretical knowledge I've gained in
                            classes such as Linear Algebra and Calculus.
                            Machine Learning is such an interesting field for me and I love seeing how different models work as
                            well as the theory behind them. I hope to
                            continue my studies in Machine Learning and continue to grow and improve.

                    <p> Othello is a popular and classic board game that I turned into a desktop app. The game was written
                            entirely in Python and I even created a GUI for it using Tkinter.
                            This project was one of the most challenging and laborious programs I've created and making it has
                            given me a whole new insight and respect for game developers.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I created the algorithms from my Othello games from scratch and I had to find algorithms to Determine
                            the winner, check corner cases, check if possible moves were
                            available and to check which pieces need to be flipped and how it affects other pieces on the board.
                            Thinking and creating these algorithms made me apply theoretical
                            Computer Science and Logical Knowledge to create efficient algorithms that wouldn't slow down the flow
                            of the game. Additionally, I created an entire GUI for
                            it using Tkinter. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I designed every part such as drawing the shapes, updating scores and times as well
                            as other background processes that happen in video games
                            that I've always taken for granted.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            But while this process was challenging, I enjoyed it and felt immensely proud of what I've created.
                            Othello is a simple game but so much had to be done
                            to just make it work and look pretty. This gave me a newfound respect for developers who create even
                            more complex video
                            game and developers who create frameworks and engines from scratch so that others may create video
                            games.
